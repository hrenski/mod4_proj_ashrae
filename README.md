# Project Description

Recent, significant investments are have made to improve client's building efficiencies to reduce costs and emissions. The question is, are the improvements working? Under pay-for-performance financing, the building owner makes payments based on the difference between their real energy consumption and what they would have used without any retrofits. The latter values have to come from a model. Current methods of estimation are fragmented and do not scale well. Some assume a specific meter type or donâ€™t work with different building types.


# Project Goal

Develop accurate models of metered building energy usage.  With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies.


# Project Dataset

The data in the project consists of:

* Known meter reading for an assorment of sites buildings
* Weather information for each of the sites
* Annotations for each of the buildings involved

# Project Methodology/Assignments

This project will consist of the following stages:

| Stage        | Description           | Assigned  | Status |
| :------------- |:-------------|:-----|:---|
| 1.      | Initial investigation of the meter readings  | David | Underway |
| 2.      | Baseline model using weather and building information      |   Chuck | Underway |
| 3. | Data conditioning and investigation      |    David / Chuck | Pending |
| 4. | Model refinement      |    - | Not Started

# Project Findings

The meter readings appear to have contaiminated with noise. Initial denoise efforts have shown an improvement in the meter reading character but modeling results are still inconclucsive.
